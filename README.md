# Discrete-Math-Toolkit

Toolkit in development with some cool features

## Truth Table Generator
Simple boolean expresion evaluator
Have in mand its really sensitive on parenthesis
This tool is a calculator that can evaluate a list of variables and operands:
 1. [p,q,r,s,u,w,x,y,z]
 2. Operands
  - ↔ Biconditional
  - → Implication
  - ^ Conjunction
  - V Disyunction
  - ~ Denial
 3. Examples of correct use:
  - (~p→~q)^(~(p^q))
  - (p^(q^(s^(r^(s^r))))) 
  - (p↔q) V ( r↔s)
  - (p→q)↔(~pVq)

## Sets operations
Simple sets operations caclulator for three sets (A,B,B)
The elements in the sets can be numbers, letters and symbols, but remember comas are used to separate elements
Available operations:
 1. Intersection
 2. Union
 3. Diference
 4. Symmetric Diference
 5. Cardinality

## Successions (sum and product)
General term, sum and product calculator
This calculator uses recursivity to calculate every element of the general term
The uper limit is n and the starting point or limit is k
