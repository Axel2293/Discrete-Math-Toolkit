# Discrete-Math-Toolkit

Toolkit in development with some cool features

## Truth Table Generator
Simple boolean expresion evaluator
Have in mand its really sensitive on parenthesis
This tool is a calculator that can evaluate a list of variables and operands:
 1. [p,q,r,s,u,w,x,y,z]
 2. Operands
  - ↔ Biconditional
  - → Implication
  - ^ Conjunction
  - V Disyunction
  - ~ Denial
 3. Examples of correct use:
  - (~p→~q)^(~(p^q))
  - (p^(q^(s^(r^(s^r))))) 
  - (p↔q) V ( r↔s)
  - (p→q)↔(~pVq)



 ### Important
 (For the moment this toolkit only has the Truth table generator, but as i advance through my D-math clase i will be working on the other parts of the toolkit)
